# Ravi Prakash Singh

## Introduction
I'm a GPU Software Engineer who has excellent understanding and hands on experience of C, C++, Vulkan API, GPU Computing Model, 3D Rendering, and 3D Mathematics.
I've worked on GPU Compilers based on LLVM, and 3D Renderer based on Vulkan API. In Open Source world, I sometimes contribute to Glslang Project which is a GLSL frontend for SPIR-V.

## Key Projects
#### [Spectrum Graphics Engine (SGE)](https://github.com/ravi688/VulkanRenderer) // Owner and the only developer/maintainer of the project
- A low level graphics engine built on Vulkan API
- SUTK - a UI library made on top of SGE, now a subproject in the same directory (VulkanRenderer/sutk)
#### [Scalable KVM Over IP](https://github.com/ravi688/SKVMOIP) // Owner and the only developer/maintainer of the project
- This project allows us to fully replay keyboard and mouse inputs and get video output in real-time
- Works even in BIOS!
- Cheaper than PiKVM for multiple machines
#### [Build Master](https://github.com/ravi688/BuildMaster/) // Owner and the only developer/maintainer of the project
- A wrapper around meson build system specifically for C/C++ projects
- Its main goal is to make it easy to build, test, package and deploy a C/C++ software, whether it is a library or executable.
#### [GLSLang](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang) // I try to contribute to this project whenever a bug interests me in it

## What tools and programming languages do I use?
| Tool/Tech | What I use it for? |
|------------|--------------------|
| LibreOffice Writer | For writing technical design documents |
| C and C++  | For writing high performance code in SGE and other projects |
| GDB | for debugging C/C++ code |
| GNU Make | for building C/C++ projects |
| Catch2 | For writing unit tests |
| Bash Scripts | for complementing GNU Make |
| Pkg Config | For packaging C/C++ projects and using them as dependencies |
| Meson/BuildMaster | Building system for my projects | 
| Vulkan | For GPU Accelerated programming, see: [SKVMOIP](https://github.com/rav688/SKVMOIP) |
| Bugzilla | Bugzilla server for bug-tracking |
| Gitlab | Gitlab self-hosted instance for Git repo hosting and DevOps (CI/CD pipelines) |
| Git | For source version control |
| Python | For process level unit testing, and automating things like adding notice in each source file or creating gdb pretty printers |
| Docker | For hosting web services on my internal servers |
| Vagrant | For creating instant virtual machines and doing some testing in them |
