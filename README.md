## Introduction
I'm a GPU Software Engineer who has excellent understanding and hands on experience of Vulkan API, GPU Computing Model, 3D Rendering, and 3D Mathematics.
I've worked on GPU Compilers based on LLVM, and 3D Renderer based on Vulkan API. In Open Source world, I contribute to Glslang Project which is a GLSL frontend for SPIR-V.

## Goal in the Engineering Career
My ultimate goal in GPU software engineering is to develop GPU Computing and Rendering frameworks for Scientific Visualizations and Simulations which will be available free of cost for anybody anywhere in the world.
I believe, many scientific concepts can be understood and analysed more conveniently with the help of GPUs and Extensive Software Support which is user friendly and doesn't require much technical in-depth knowledge.

## Key Projects
[Spectrum Graphics Engine (SGE)](https://github.com/ravi688/VulkanRenderer) // Owner and the only developer/maintainer of the project

[GLSLang](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang) // Contributer

## What tools and programming languages do I use?
- LibreOffice Writer : For writing technical design documents
- C and C++ : For writing high performance code in SGE and other projects
- Vulkan: For GPU Accelerated programming, see: [SKVMOIP](https://github.com/rav688/SKVMOIP)
- Bugzilla: Bugzilla server for bug-tracking
- Gitlab: Gitlab instance for hosting mirror repositories and their internal CI/CD
- Git: For source code management
- Python: For automating thigs like adding notice in each source file or creating gdb pretty printers.
